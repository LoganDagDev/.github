### Welcome to the *"Logan Dag Dev (LDD)"* Organization!

## About

We are an organization focused around Faith in God, helping others, bringing people together, and doing it all through technology and using it for good and God's glory. The purpose of this github organization is:
* track projects
* Keep the public up to date
* Allow others to contribute to projects
* Allow a majority of projects be open-source
* And allow others to communicate in a community of others who are like-minded

We are a small organization with limited resources, we will do the best we can to help others, do as much as we can, and review forks, commits, etc in a timely manner.
