### Welcome to the *"Logan Dag Dev (LDD)"* Organization!

## About

We are an organization focused around Faith in God, helping others, bringing people together, and doing it all through technology and using it for good and God's glory. The purpose of this github organization is:
* track projects
* Keep the public up to date
* Allow others to contribute to projects
* Allow a majority of projects be open-source
* And allow others to communicate in a community of others who are like-minded

We are a small organization with limited resources, we will do the best we can to help others, do as much as we can, and review forks, commits, etc in a timely manner.


### How to obtain a specific project
Each project will have a link to its own seperate repository and a  tag(s) associated with its current status. If you want to check it out, please look at the repository associated with that project and please respect the tag's meaning mentioned below.

Security is **AS IS, NOT GUARANTEED, AND HAS NO WARRANTY.**

Any current project being developed will have security pages as well.

- Current projects will have the *"Current-project"* tag. May be only given a link to their repo in the status area below.

- Old projects **NOT** for public release will have *"Archived-not-public-use"*.

- Releases for public use will have *"Public-use"* assigned.

- Projects that may be restarted later on will be assigned the *"Be-Revived-Later"* tag. These may be projects that were once abandoned and might be worked and re-worked later in the future. These projects will have a link to their repo in the status area below., especially if they will be turned into an *"Current-Project"*.

- The *"Future-Project"* tag will be assigned to projects and things that I might work on later, most likely given their own repo, and will have a link to their repo in the status area below. Status will be changed when finished or have a stable release for the public.

- The *"Needs-Rework"* tag will be assigned to projects that have bugs or need fixes that require a major overall.

- The *"Complete-Replacement-Needed"* tag will be given to projects that will be completely replaced by another project all together or a complete rework of the project.

**Please respect the meaning of the tags.**
